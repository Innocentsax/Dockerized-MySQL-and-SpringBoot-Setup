## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of MySQL and Spring Boot.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine to access the necessary files and configurations for this setup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Innocentsax/Dockerized-MySQL-and-SpringBoot-Setup.git
cd Dockerized-MySQL-and-SpringBoot-Setup
```

## Setting Up MySQL

In this section, we'll configure and run a MySQL container using Docker:

- **Step 1:** Define the MySQL Docker container's environment variables and credentials.
- **Step 2:** Create a Docker network for communication between the MySQL container and Spring Boot application.
- **Step 3:** Launch the MySQL container with the defined configurations.

<!-- Detailed instructions for setting up MySQL can be found in the [Setting Up MySQL](./docs/mysql-setup.md) documentation. -->

## Creating a Spring Boot Application

Here, we'll create a basic Spring Boot application:

- **Step 1:** Set up a Spring Boot project with the required dependencies.
- **Step 2:** Configure the Spring Boot application properties.
- **Step 3:** Create a simple REST API endpoint.

<!-- You can follow the instructions in [Creating a Spring Boot Application](./docs/spring-boot-setup.md) for detailed guidance. -->

## Dockerizing the Application

In this section, we'll containerize our Spring Boot application:

- **Step 1:** Create a Dockerfile for your Spring Boot application.
- **Step 2:** Build a Docker image of your application.
- **Step 3:** Run your Spring Boot application in a Docker container.

<!-- For a more in-depth explanation, check out [Dockerizing the Application](./docs/dockerize-app.md). -->

## Running and Testing

Now that your MySQL and Spring Boot application are in Docker containers, it's time to run and test them:

- **Step 1:** Start both containers.
- **Step 2:** Verify that the Spring Boot application can connect to the MySQL database.
- **Step 3:** Test your Spring Boot application.

<!-- Learn more about running and testing your setup in [Running and Testing](./docs/running-and-testing.md). -->

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully Dockerized MySQL and your Spring Boot application, creating a development environment 
that is easy to manage and deploy. This guide has walked you through each step, ensuring you have a solid foundation for building 
and deploying database-driven Spring Boot applications in Docker containers.

Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or explore further improvements to enhance your development experience.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
